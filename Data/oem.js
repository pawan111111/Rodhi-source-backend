      paragraph: "'OEM' is a term for 'Original Equipment Manufacturer' and is used in practically every sector. It is similar to 'private label' or 'white label,' both of which refer to production outsourcing. The word OEM currently refers to a company purchasing a product to be reused or merged into another product under the reseller's brand name. OEM may also refer to a company that makes an end product using parts from another company. We provide you with specialized and customized services such as OEM, White labeling, package design, logo print, factory audit, and sample consolidations so you don't have to worry about anything related to building your own brand.",
