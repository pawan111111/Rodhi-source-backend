      title: "First of all lets talk about The name Rodhi",
      paragraph1: "Rodhi is derived from Nepal's Gurung Cultural House, “Rodhi Ghar”. Rodhi Ghar is essentially a place to relax, a house in the village where the community gathered after a full day’s work to sing, dance, and be festive. At the rodhi Ghar, the otherwise rigid norms defining gender relations were set aside. All the members of the Rodighar work together and share their happiness and joy. So, this helps in making the people of that community closer. The Rodhighar is a good example of cooperation, assistance, better relation, and collective spirits among the Gurungs.",
