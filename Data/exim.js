      paragraph: "Managing payment and shipping procedures for international trade can be a complex process. Two common methods of payment are Telegraphic Transfer (TT) and Letter of Credit (LC), both of which involve banks and require careful attention to details. Additionally, each product being traded must be classified under a specific code in the Harmonized System, known as the EXIM code, to ensure smooth customs clearance and accurate payment of duties and taxes. Our team is well-versed in these procedures and can assist you in navigating them effectively. From managing the TT or LC process to accurately classifying your products under the correct EXIM code, we are here to support your international trade operations and ensure a smooth and successful experience.",
